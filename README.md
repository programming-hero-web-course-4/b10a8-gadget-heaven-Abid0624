## List of React Fundamental Concepts Used

This project implements the following core React concepts:

1. **State Management**:

   - `useState` for managing states like cart, wishlist, total cost, modal visibility, etc.

2. **Effect Hook**:

   - `useEffect` for fetching cart and wishlist data and recalculating the total cost whenever the cart changes.

3. **Conditional Rendering**:

   - Conditionally rendering the cart, wishlist, and modal components based on the state.

4. **Props**:

   - Passing data to reusable components like `Cart` and `Wishlist`.

5. **Event Handling**:
   - Handling user interactions such as sorting, toggling views, purchasing items, and resetting the cart.
